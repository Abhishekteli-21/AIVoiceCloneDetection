Our hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn't lead to a broader regional conflict. 
And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they're responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the 
terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with.
